# FRI-ReinforcementLearning-C
*Fuzzy Rule Interpolation-based Reinforcement Learning* (FRIRL - ANSI C + AVX port)

For details about FRIRL itself please see the main [FRI-ReinforcementLearnin repository](https://github.com/szaguldo-kamaz/FRI-ReinforcementLearning/)
This C + AVX port is a bit behind the MATLAB implementation, but indeed it is significantly faster.

About the AVX optimization parts, you can find more information in this paper:
